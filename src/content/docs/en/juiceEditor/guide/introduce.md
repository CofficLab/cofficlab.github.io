## Why Develop JuiceEditor

The author, frequently needing to take notes, tried many note-taking software but was unsatisfied:

- Some had too few features
- Some had too many features
- Some had poor interaction

So the author decided to develop a note-taking APP to meet his own needs.

The rich text editor for this note-taking APP is JuiceEditor.

For the author's usage requirements, JuiceEditor needs to meet the following criteria:

- Powerful functionality
- Good interaction
- Extensible
- Embeddable in APPs
- Concise
- Embeddable in web pages
- SEO friendly

This is a large project, and despite the author's efforts, it is still under development and not yet stable as of 2024.

## What's Different

- JuiceEditor is embedded in the page as a tag: `<juice-editor></juice-editor>`;
- It can be used with any framework, in any environment that supports Javascript, CSS, and HTML;
- JuiceEditor has a built-in plugin system, allowing flexible addition of plugins to implement more features, such as:
  - While writing an article, you can open a drawing component at any time to insert a flowchart

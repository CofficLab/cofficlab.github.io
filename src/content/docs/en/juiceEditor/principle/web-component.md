## What is a Web Component

Web Components are a set of standards that allow developers to create reusable custom elements and integrate them into web pages.

## Web Component in JuiceEditor

JuiceEditor encapsulates complex rendering logic within a Web Component. For users, they only need to add this tag to their page to render a sophisticated rich text editor:

```html
<juice-editor></juice-editor>
```

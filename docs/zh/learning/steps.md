### Say Hello to the Terminal App

Every macOS user has a Terminal app. It is the most powerful tool in our arsenal.

- Print the current directory:

    ```bash
    pwd
    ```

- List all files in the current directory:

- Change the current directory:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Desktop
    ```

- Create a new directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir new_directory
    ```

- Create a new file:

    ```bash
    touch new_file.txt
    ```

    You can also use the following command to create a new file:

    ```bash
    echo "Hello, World!" > new_file.txt
    ```

    The above command will create a new file named `new_file.txt`
    and write the text "Hello, World!" in it.
- Delete a file:

    ```bash
    rm new_file.txt
    ```

## Say Hello to PHP

### Print the time

- Open this project with Visual Studio Code
- Open the terminal app by pressing `Ctrl + ~`

Follow the steps below to print the time.

1. Create a new file called `time.php` in the `docs/php` directory of this project.

    ```

Now, you have learned how to write a PHP file and run it.

### Function

Create a new file called `function.php` in the `docs/php` directory of this project.

Write a function to print the Fibonacci sequence. Fill in the missing code.

```php
<?php

echo fibonacci(100);

function fibonacci($n) {
    // your code here
}
```

### Array Sorting

Create a new file called `array_sorting.php` in the `docs/php` directory of
this project.

Here is a function that takes two arrays and merges them into one and sort in
ascending order. Fill in the missing code.

```php
<?php
$a = [1, 2, 5];
$b = [3, 4];

$c = array_merge_and_sort($a, $b);
print_r($c);

function array_merge_and_sort($a, $b) {
    // your code here
}
```

The array `c` should be: `[1,2,3,4,5]`.

### HTTP Server

Create a new file called `http_server.php` in the `docs/php` directory of this project.

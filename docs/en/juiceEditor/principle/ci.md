## Synchronizing Build Artifacts to Other Projects

After releasing a new version, it's necessary to synchronize the build artifacts of this project to other projects that use it.

Taking synchronization to the Kuaiyizhi_APP project as an example, follow these steps:

- A Personal Access Token is required, which can be generated in the administrator's GitHub settings: <https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta>
- Owner: The organization to which Kuaiyizhi_APP belongs
- Contents: Read and write permissions
